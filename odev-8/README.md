## Random Gifts Distribute

User list will be taken with input from the user and random gifts will be distributed.

* The user will input names in lots of names with commas ("omer, abdulhamid, mohamed, stif" etc.).

* When the Submit button is pressed, these names will be transferred to the array with the split() function.

* A random number will be chosen as much as the number of users and a gift will be given to that person.

* Gift winners and gifts should be removed from the series.

* Who won what gift last will be written on the screen by span.
